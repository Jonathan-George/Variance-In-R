# Variance-In-R

In this RStudio project, i solved for the variance of 2 datasets of teacher grades(teacher_one_grades and teacher_two_grades) to determine which of the 2 had a bigger and smaller Variance.. My project determined that the variance of teacher_one_grades at 4.26651788888889 is more stable and acceptable than that of teacher_two_grades at 78.1319893333334..... Attached to this github project is the Histogram plot of both grades.
